---QUESTION---
---TITLE---
Assigning a Value to a Variable

---DESCRIPTION---
In this exercise, you'll practice assigning a value to a variable in JavaScript.

Your task is to:
- Create a variable named `p`
- Assign the value 53 to this variable

This exercise will help you understand:
- How to declare variables
- How to assign values to variables

Remember to leave the `console.log(p)` statement at the end of your code. This is necessary for testing your solution.

---INITIALCODE---
// Your code here


// Do not modify the code below this line
console.log(p);

---TESTCASES---
[
  { "func": "console.log(p)", "expected": "53", "type": "console" }
]

---EXPLANATION---
Variables are fundamental in programming. They allow us to store and manipulate data. Here's what you need to do:

1. Declare a variable named `p` using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword.
2. Assign the value 53 to this variable.

This exercise introduces you to:
- Variable declaration
- Value assignment

Remember, in JavaScript, you can declare and assign a value to a variable in one line.

The `console.log(p)` statement at the end will print the value of `p`, which helps in verifying your solution.

---SOLUTION---
const p = 53;

// Do not modify the code below this line
console.log(p);
