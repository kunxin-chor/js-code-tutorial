---QUESTION---
---TITLE---
How Old Are You?

---DESCRIPTION---
Write a function that calculates a person's age based on their birth year and the current year.

The function should:
1. Use the `prompt` function to ask for the birth year
2. Use the `prompt` function to ask for the current year
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year
4. Print the result using `console.log`

**Important**: Do not use any unnecessary `console.log` statements except for the final result.

### Example

If the user enters "1995" for birth year and "2020" for current year, the output should be: `25`

### Hints

- Remember that `prompt` returns a string, so you need to convert it to a number
- You can use the `Number()` function or the unary plus operator (`+`) to convert strings to numbers
- Subtract the birth year from the current year to calculate the age
- Use only one `console.log` statement to output the final result

---INITIALCODE---
function calculateAge() {
  // Your code here
}

---TESTCASES---
[
  {
    "func": "calculateAge()",
    "expected": "25",
    "type": "console",
    "prompts": ["1995", "2020"]
  },
  {
    "func": "calculateAge()",
    "expected": "-20",
    "type": "console",
    "prompts": ["2020", "2000"]
  },
  {
    "func": "calculateAge()",
    "expected": "58",
    "type": "console",
    "prompts": ["1962", "2020"]
  }
]

---EXPLANATION---
The `calculateAge` function demonstrates how to use the `prompt` function to get input from the user, perform a calculation, and then output the result. Here's how it works:

1. It uses `prompt` twice to ask the user for their birth year and the current year.
2. It converts the input strings to numbers and calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
3. It then uses `console.log` to print the result.

This exercise helps practice:
- Using the `prompt` function for user input
- Converting strings to numbers
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Output formatting



---SOLUTION---
function calculateAge() {
  const birthYear = Number(prompt("Enter your birth year:"));
  const currentYear = Number(prompt("Enter the current year:"));
  const age = currentYear - birthYear;
  console.log(age);
}
